# The-Studio-Ghibli-API-Java
Created a Java application for connecting to the Studio Ghibli API.

1) Connected to the Studio Ghibli API and retrieved a list of all movies.  Displayed this list of movies to the user. Displayed the title and description of the movie.

2) Repeatedly prompted the user to select a movie or quit.  The user may select a movie by typing its title. 

3) Displayed the title, description, release date , and producer of that selected movie, or "Movie not found" if that title doesn't exist in the API.
